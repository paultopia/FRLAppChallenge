# About the EAT School Lunch UX Challenge

Traditionally, households have applied for free or reduced-price meal benefits by submitting paper or online applications to their schools. Millions of these applications are filed every year, and nearly 10 million low income children were approved to receive benefits in school year 2014-15 through these applications.

However, due to issues with reporting, calculating, and processing, many applications contain errors that result in incorrect eligibility decisions for children.

The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) offers a prototype paper application on its website, and thousands of school districts have adopted or modified that application for their own use. Many districts also offer online applications, but the FNS does not have an electronic prototype for them to use as a model. And that’s where you come in! 

We want you to develop a forward-looking, web-based application form using personalized behavioral prompts, UX best practices, and edit-checks to assist in accurate form completion. 

Applications must be skillfully and artfully designed to limit the burden on applicants and achieve two additional goals: 

Facilitate access to program benefits for eligible children, and
Strengthen program integrity by reducing application errors.
Through this hackathon, we hope to develop a prototype that can be shared with all school districts, and that incorporates the best ideas and insights from UX designers and software developers. By participating, you have the chance to impact the user experience of millions of applicants and improve a program that helps ensure that American children have access to healthy school meals.
